# pixi share ( ๑‾̀◡‾́)σ"

I created this DApp out of curiosity about how a decentralized app would work :) It is essentially an image-sharing platform with the Ethereum blockchain as the data storage place and allows for user tokenization ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡° )

The idea behind using blockchain technology for social media is that it offers users ownership and control over their data while countering algorithmic content filtering. It provides a decentralized and transparent platform for sharing news media and opinions :).
