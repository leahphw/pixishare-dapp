This decentralized application (dApp) enables users to share pictures and engage in a censorship-resistant social media platform. It leverages the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts written in Solidity for transparency and security. The backend is built with Node.js, while the user interface is developed using React and Bootstrap.

By utilizing blockchain technology, the app offers users ownership and control over their data, while countering algorithmic content filtering. It provides a decentralized and transparent platform for sharing news, media, and personal moments.
